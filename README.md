# Handwriting Recognition

This project focuses on developing a system for recognizing text in handwritten images. It involves preprocessing the data to convert text labels into a numerical format and training neural networks for text recognition tasks.

## Key Components:

### Data Label Preprocessing:

- **Character Set and Constants:** Define the set of valid characters, maximum input label length, and other constants.
- **Label-to-Number Conversion:** Convert text labels into a numerical representation for training.
- **Number-to-Label Conversion:** Convert numerical representations back into text labels for evaluation.

### Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) Architecture:

- **Input Layer:** Accept grayscale images with dimensions of 256x64 pixels.
- **Convolutional Layers:** Apply convolutional filters and pooling operations for feature extraction.
- **Reshape Layer:** Reshape the output of convolutional layers for sequence processing.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Layers:** Utilize bidirectional LSTM layers for sequence modeling.
- **Output Layer:** Output layer with softmax activation for character prediction.

### Training and Evaluation:

- **CTC Loss Calculation:** Compute the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss between predicted and true labels.
- **Training the Model:** Train the CRNN model using preprocessed data and evaluate its performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess the model's performance using character-level accuracy and other metrics.
